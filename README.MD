# Tutorial-o-Matic

Here I'm developing a [Freeplane AddOn](https://www.freeplane.org/wiki/index.php/Add-ons_(install)) that will help users to create Tutorials for [Freeplane](https://www.freeplane.org/wiki/index.php/Home).

It is in "work in progress" state, but I loaded a first addOn version that shows how it will work. It is a demo version.

Look under [Releases](https://github.com/EdoFro/Freeplane_Tutorial_AddOn/releases) in this repository.

Bye,

edo
